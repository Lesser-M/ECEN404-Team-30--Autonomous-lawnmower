Problem Statement from Sponsor: 
" You will start with a lawn mower shell, add motors to propel the wheels, microcontroller to control everything, 
comms to a wifi network where area to be covered and route will be entered, and a power mechanism (docking station or other)‚Äù

***Project Summary***
We used an old lawnmower shell, stripped it of all its parts, added Motors, powersupply, wiring, Microcontroller and sensors to it to achive our mission. 

The code presented here is for 2MCUs, the PIC-32 used for GPS and obstacle detection, as well as the ESP32 used for user interface and Navigation.
Additionally presented is Code for the app, and other interface structure, along with code developed for this project but not used during demo. 

As the main project report is presented elsewhere, we will not go into detail here, but instead refer the reader to the READMEs in the appropriate sections, and the Report
