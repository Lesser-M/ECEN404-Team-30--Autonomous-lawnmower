Team Number: 30 
Team Members: Max Lesser, Vincent McMasters, Joshua Samaniego, Jonatahan Pouluse 
Sponsor: Stavros Kalafatis 

403 TA: Pranav Duphila 
403 Professor: S. Kalafatis

404 Professor: J. Lusher

Probelm Statement from Sponsor: 
" You will start with a lawn mower shell, add motors to propel the wheels, microcontroller to control everything, 
comms to a wifi network where area to be covered and route will be entered, and a power mechanism (docking station or other)‚Äù

***GITHUB structure*** 
This Repository contains all of our final reports, code and any other items we are submitting in relation to the final report. 
The repo contains the following folders and sub folders, with purpose as listed below

-CodeDemoed: Contains the code running on the mower at demo time 
          -/APP-Code: Contains the code for the app running the user interface 
          -/ESP-32: contains code running on ESP32 at demo time, nameley code for Navigation and to interface with the User via wifi network 
          -/PIC-32: Contains code running on the PIC-32 during demo time, Nameley code for obstacle detection 
          -/Server: contains any code running on the server needed to connect the ESP32 to the User interface 
-Additiona Code- Not used during Demo: contains code written for this project that was not implemnted at demo time 
          -/JONATHAN: code written by Jonatahn that was not used during demo time 
          -/JOSH: code written by Josh that was not used during demo time 
          -/MAX: code written by max that was not used during demo time 
-Reports-404: contains all written Reports for this semester 
-Videos: contains demo video, and other video or picture that is relevant but not included in the report 

each of these directories has a README file expalining it further, along with the purpose of any child directories not mentioned here
The README shall clearly state who is responsible for the code. Detailed explanations are reserved for the report in the Reports-404 section

***Project Summary***
We used an old lawnmower shell, stripped it of all its parts, added Motors, powersupply, wiring, Microcontroller and sensors to it to achive our mission. 

The code presented here is for 2MCUs, the PIC-32 used for GPS and obstacle detection, as well as the ESP32 used for user interface and Navigation.
Additionally presented is Code for the app, and other interface structure, along with code developed for this project but not used during demo. 

As the main project report is presented elsewhere, we will not go into detail here, but instead refer the reader to the READMEs in the appropriate sections, and the Report
