README for PIC-32 demo Code
Written by Max Lesser 
This section includes the code running on the PIC-32 during demo 
the full project is included in a sub folder in this directory, but relevant source code is here 

Summary: 
the PIC-32 controlls obstalce detection and GPS. it reads the sensor array, finds min distance to obstacle, and alerts the ESP-32. 
It also reads the GPS module and parses the revceived sentance for relvant data. And can send this to the ESP via UART. 
It also includes a side obstacle detection function 

Comments: 
As I had to rebuild the entire Motor subsystem and nav code at the very end of the semester, along with general integration of the mower,
i was not able to implement some of this functionality. The code on the PIC all works as intended, i just did not have the time to 
make use of everything on the ESP. 


Contents

ObjectDetect: 
can read front and side sensors, find side of mower obstacle is on and minimum distance. can report to ESP via UART. 
implemented as: 
reads front array only, alerts ESP via alert pin. 

sensor_read 
configures and reads from GPS module. And parses received sentence. Can send to ESP via UART. 
impelemnted as: 
attempted to use GPS course reading to correct course on ESP, did not work due to slow update rate, and the fact that the mower needs 
to be moving in order to get an accurate reading of the course. 
Therefore not used during final demo.
