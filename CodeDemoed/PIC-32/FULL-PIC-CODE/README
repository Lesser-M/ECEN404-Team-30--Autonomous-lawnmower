Includes entire Harmony project for PIC-32, including all soruce code in parent direcotry, as well as config code/ hardware config etc. 
Here for compleatness sake, not intended for review. (although you are welcome to, but the interesting stuff is in the parent direcotry) 

Note: source files in parent directory are functionally the same as here, but with slighlty updated comments
