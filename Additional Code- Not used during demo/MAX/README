code written by Max that did not run on the mower during demo 

Accel_Gyro_Compass: 
code used to read compass and try to get compass heading for NAV 
compass heading varried by +- 60 deg without ever moving the unit or activating motors. 
Concluded issue in sensor, and did not implement for this reasson 

Nav_code_Lesser_New_driverts_GPS_ODET 
Edit of nav code, for new driver boards, that included obstacle detection and GPS 
large portions of this code were copied into the code that ran during demo. 
this code attempted to read GPS to correct course, but due to low refresh rate of GPS module ( >1Hz) 
and the fact that couse information from the GPS would not be usefull unless the mower was moving forward. 
This approach did not work. ( ie we can't take enough points along a path to get a course. and i did not have 
the time at the end to truly work out a way where we can take a single GPS course reading while underway, given that 
update reate is less than once pre sec) 

Nav_code_Lesser_New_driverts_Gyro
Similar version as above, but attempting to use gyro to help turn better. 
Issues with the Gyro prevented this from working ( see Accel_Gyro_Compass section) 
many parts of this code did land in the code we used during demo 

capstone.c 
intial prototype for obstacle location code. 
Not used as sensors were to incaccurate to work well with this code. 
Many parts of this code did make it into the PIC-32 ObjectDetect code 

NAV_CODE_Lesser_edit2 & NAV_CODE_lesseredit_ODET
Previous versions of Nav code that formed the basis for other code here and that used during demo 

NOTE: 
protions of Nav code were built upon pin declaractions and configurations josh previoulsy wrote. 
the code retained from Joshes version in any of the above versions is in no case more than 30.  
For an exact breakdown of who wrote what portion of the code is done for the code used during demo.
