Code written by Jonathan that did not run on the mower for the demo video.

*Wrote code for Both WiFi and Nav ESPs seperately because we were using two at the time*

WIFIMCU Folder Code: 
    -Connects to Wifi for Firebase Server & Connects to Nav ESP
    -Receives coordinates & start_status from Firebase Server
    -Recieves battery information/statistics from Nav ESP
    -Sends battery information/statistics to firebase server
    -Sends coordinates & start_status to NAV ESP

NAVMCU Folder Code:
    -Creates WiFi Network so WiFi MCU can connect to it
    -Sends battery information/statistics to WiFi ESP
    -Recieves coordinates & start_status from WiFi ESP

WiFiandNAVMCU Code: *THIS WAS THE CODE USED BECAUSE WE ENDED UP COMBINING THE ESP code together*
    -Connects to Wifi for Firebase Server 
    -Receives coordinates,start_status,battery information/statistics from Firebase Server
    -Converts 4 coordinates into Distances
    -Navigates the Mower
